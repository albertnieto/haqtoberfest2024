    "1) QUBO formulation for the Knapsack Problem (KP)\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1) Give the analytical description of the QUBO formulation for the Knapsack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$Q = -\\sum_{i=0}^N v_i q_i + \\alpha\\left(\\sum_{i,j=0}^N w_i w_j q_i q_j - 2\\sum_{i=0}^N\\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor}w_i a_j q_i s_j - +\\sum_{i,j=0}^{\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor} a_i a_j s_i s_j\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $\\alpha = max\\;  v_i +1$ and $a_j = \\begin{cases} 2^j & j<\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor \\\\ W-2^{\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor}+1 & j=\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor \\end{cases}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1.2) Find the optimal number of slack variables and their coefficients $a_i$ for any range (assume that $S$ has a range $[0, M]$)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given that $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_{slack}}a_i s_i \\in [0,W]$, we can do a decimal-to-binary encoding (sometimes referred to as the \"log trick\"), and encode the weight in binary variables. Thus, we use $\\log{2}{W}$ slack variables and have $a_i = 2^i$. Nonetheless, this would give us only the option to represent a maximum weight that is a power of 2 minus 1, so we need to modify the last parameter, $a_{\\log{2}{W}}$, and force it to match the maximum weight as $a_i = W-2^{\\lfloor \\log{2}{W} \\rfloor}+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.3) Find the minimum value for the Lagrange multiplier in order to ensure the problem constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider we go over the maximum weight by one object with $w_i = 1$. This object will contribute with at most $-v_{max}$ to Q, so we have to penalize it with some $\\alpha>v_{max}$, such as $\\alpha = max \\; v_i + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.4) Write a code that given a KP instance, automatically generates the QUBO matrix as the weights matrix $Q$ from the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.5) Write a function that given a solution, returns the value for the slack variables that fulfill the constraint (if possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.6) Code a function that given a bitstring solution, returns the associated cost function value using the Hamiltonian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.7) Extend the formulation to include the following dependencies between the items accepted by the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If items $i$ and $j$ are included, the total value is increased by an additional quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $-\\Delta q_i q_j$, where $\\Delta$ is an additional quantity.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - If one of the items $i$ and $j$ is included without the other, the total value is decreased by a given quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $(1-q_i q_j)(1-(1-q_i)(1-q_j))$, which is an implementation of the XOR gate, and can be further simplified to quadratic form taking into account that $q_i^2 = q_i$.\n"
